How to host your website on Google App Engine:
1. Sign up to http://appengine.google.com
2. Create a new application (I named mine webtest-12345).
3. Install the Python SDK https://developers.google.com/appengine/downloads
4. Create a new directory with an app.yaml file like this:
   https://github.com/kig/app-engine-demo-static/blob/master/app.yaml
   (replace webtest-12345 with the name of your app).
5. Create a subdir www/ and put your site there, remember to have index.html. 
6. Start the Google App Engine Launcher and do "Add Existing Application...",
   pointing it to the directory with the app.yaml file.
7. Test locally.
8. When happy, click deploy.
9. Done! (Check it out: http://webtest-12345.appspot.com/)

If you want to have a more automatic experience, here's a small script:

  export MY_APP_NAME=your-app-name-here;
  git clone https://github.com/kig/app-engine-demo-static.git;
  cd app-engine-demo-static;
  sed -e "s/webtest-12345/$MY_APP_NAME/" -i '' app.yaml;
  appcfg.py update .
